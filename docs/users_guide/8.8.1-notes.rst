Language
~~~~~~~

- :extension:`ScopedTypeVariables`: The type variable that a type signature on
  a pattern can bring into scope can now stand for arbitrary types. Previously,
  they could only stand in for other type variables, but this restriction was deemed
  unnecessary in `GHC proposal #29 <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0029-scoped-type-variables-types.rst>`__. Also see :ghc-ticket:`15050`.
