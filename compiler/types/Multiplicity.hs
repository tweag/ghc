{-|
This module defines the semi-ring of multiplicities, and associated functions.
Multiplicities annotate arrow types to indicate the linearity of the
arrow (in the sense of linear types).

Mult is a type synonym for Type, used only when its kind is Multiplicity.
To simplify dealing with multiplicities, functions such as
mkMultMul perform simplifications such as Omega * x = Omega on the fly.

Note [Adding new multiplicities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To add a new multiplicity, you need to:
* Add the new type with Multiplicity kind
* Update cases in mkMultAdd, mkMultMul, mkMultSup, submult, tcSubMult
* Check supUE function that computes sup of a multiplicity
  and Zero

  where Omega = omegaDataConTy

{-
The functions mkMultAdd, mkMultMul, mkMultSup perform operations
on multiplicities. They can return overapproximations: their result
is merely guaranteed to be a submultiplicity of the actual value.

They should be used only when an upper bound is acceptable.
In most cases, they are used in usage environments (UsageEnv);
in usage environments, replacing a usage with a larger one can only
cause more programs to fail to typecheck.

In future work, instead of approximating we might add type families
and allow users to write types involving operations on multiplicities.
In this case, we could enforce more invariants in Mult, for example,
enforce that that it is in the form of a sum of  products, and even
that the sumands and factors are ordered somehow, to have more equalities.
