{- Note [Constructed Product Result]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The goal of Constructed Product Result analysis is to identify functions that
surely return heap-allocated records on every code path, so that we can
eliminate said heap allocation by performing a worker/wrapper split.

@swap@ below is such a function:

  swap (a, b) = (b, a)

A @case@ on an application of @swap@, like
@case swap (10, 42) of (a, b) -> a + b@ could cancel away
(by case-of-known-constructor) if we "inlined" @swap@ and simplified. We then
say that @swap@ has the CPR property.

We can't inline recursive functions, but similar reasoning applies there:

  f x n = case n of
    0 -> (x, 0)
    _ -> f (x+1) (n-1)

Inductively, @case f 1 2 of (a, b) -> a + b@ could cancel away the constructed
product with the case. So @f@, too, has the CPR property. But we can't really
"inline" @f@, because it's recursive. Also, non-recursive functions like @swap@
might be too big to inline (or even marked NOINLINE). We still want to exploit
the CPR property, and that is exactly what the worker/wrapper transformation
can do for us:

  $wf x n = case n of
    0 -> case (x, 0) of -> (a, b) -> (# a, b #)
    _ -> case f (x+1) (n-1) of (a, b) -> (# a, b #)
  f x n = case $wf x n of (# a, b #) -> (a, b)

where $wf readily simplifies (by case-of-known-constructor and inlining @f@) to:

  $wf x n = case n of
    0 -> (# x, 0 #)
    _ -> $wf (x+1) (n-1)

Now, a call site like @case f 1 2 of (a, b) -> a + b@ can inline @f@ and
eliminate the heap-allocated pair constructor.

Note [Phase ordering]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We need to perform strictness analysis before CPR analysis, because that might
unbox some arguments, in turn leading to more constructed products.
Ideally, we would want the following pipeline:

1. Strictness
2. worker/wrapper (for strictness)
3. CPR
4. worker/wrapper (for CPR)

Currently, we omit 2. and anticipate the results of worker/wrapper.
See Note [CPR in a DataAlt case alternative] and Note [CPR for strict binders].
An additional w/w pass would simplify things, but probably add slight overhead.
So currently we have

1. Strictness
2. CPR
3. worker/wrapper (for strictness and CPR)

{- Note [Arity trimming for CPR signatures]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Although it doesn't affect correctness of the analysis per se, we have to trim
CPR signatures to idArity. Here's what might happen if we don't:

  f x = if expensive
          then \y. Box y
          else \z. Box z
  g a b = f a b

The two lambdas will have a CPR type of @1m@ (so construct a product after
applied to one argument). Thus, @f@ will have a CPR signature of @2m@
(constructs a product after applied to two arguments).
But WW will never eta-expand @f@! In this case that would amount to possibly
duplicating @expensive@ work.

(Side note: Even if @f@'s 'idArity' happened to be 2, it would not do so, see
Note [Don't eta expand in w/w].)

So @f@ will not be worker/wrappered. But @g@ also inherited its CPR signature
from @f@'s, so it *will* be WW'd:

  f x = if expensive
          then \y. Box y
          else \z. Box z
  $wg a b = case f a b of Box x -> x
  g a b = Box ($wg a b)

And the case in @g@ can never cancel away, thus we introduced extra reboxing.
Hence we always trim the CPR signature of a binding to idArity.

{- Note [Safe abortion in the fixed-point iteration]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed-point iteration may fail to terminate. But we cannot simply give up and
return the environment and code unchanged! We still need to do one additional
round, to ensure that all expressions have been traversed at least once, and any
unsound CPR annotations have been updated.

Note [CPR in a DataAlt case alternative]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In a case alternative, we want to give some of the binders the CPR property.
Specifically

 * The case binder; inside the alternative, the case binder always has
   the CPR property, meaning that a case on it will successfully cancel.
   Example:
        f True  x = case x of y { I# x' -> if x' ==# 3
                                           then y
                                           else I# 8 }
        f False x = I# 3

   By giving 'y' the CPR property, we ensure that 'f' does too, so we get
        f b x = case fw b x of { r -> I# r }
        fw True  x = case x of y { I# x' -> if x' ==# 3 then x' else 8 }
        fw False x = 3

   Of course there is the usual risk of re-boxing: we have 'x' available
   boxed and unboxed, but we return the unboxed version for the wrapper to
   box.  If the wrapper doesn't cancel with its caller, we'll end up
   re-boxing something that we did have available in boxed form.

 * Any strict binders with product type, can use Note [CPR for strict binders]
   to anticipate worker/wrappering for strictness info.
   But we can go a little further. Consider

      data T = MkT !Int Int

      f2 (MkT x y) | y>0       = f2 (MkT x (y-1))
                   | otherwise = x

   For $wf2 we are going to unbox the MkT *and*, since it is strict, the
   first argument of the MkT; see Note [Add demands for strict constructors].
   But then we don't want box it up again when returning it!  We want
   'f2' to have the CPR property, so we give 'x' the CPR property.

 * It's a bit delicate because we're brittly anticipating worker/wrapper here.
   If the case above is scrutinising something other than an argument the
   original function, we really don't have the unboxed version available.  E.g
      g v = case foo v of
              MkT x y | y>0       -> ...
                      | otherwise -> x
   Here we don't have the unboxed 'x' available.  Hence the
   is_var_scrut test when making use of the strictness annotation.
   Slightly ad-hoc, because even if the scrutinee *is* a variable it
   might not be a onre of the arguments to the original function, or a
   sub-component thereof.  But it's simple, and nothing terrible
   happens if we get it wrong.  e.g. Trac #10694.

Note [CPR for strict binders]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If a lambda-bound variable is marked demanded with a strict demand, then give it
a CPR signature, anticipating the results of worker/wrapper. Here's a concrete
example ('f1' in test T10482a), assuming h is strict:

  f1 :: Int -> Int
  f1 x = case h x of
          A -> x
          B -> f1 (x-1)
          C -> x+1

If we notice that 'x' is used strictly, we can give it the CPR
property; and hence f1 gets the CPR property too.  It's sound (doesn't
change strictness) to give it the CPR property because by the time 'x'
is returned (case A above), it'll have been evaluated (by the wrapper
of 'h' in the example).

Moreover, if f itself is strict in x, then we'll pass x unboxed to
f1, and so the boxed version *won't* be available; in that case it's
very helpful to give 'x' the CPR property.

Note that

  * We only want to do this for something that definitely
    has product type, else we may get over-optimistic CPR results
    (e.g. from \x -> x!).

  * See Note [CPR examples]

Note [CPR for sum types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the moment we do not do CPR for let-bindings that
   * non-top level
   * bind a sum type
Reason: I found that in some benchmarks we were losing let-no-escapes,
which messed it all up.  Example
   let j = \x. ....
   in case y of
        True  -> j False
        False -> j True
If we w/w this we get
   let j' = \x. ....
   in case y of
        True  -> case j' False of { (# a #) -> Just a }
        False -> case j' True of { (# a #) -> Just a }
Notice that j' is not a let-no-escape any more.

However this means in turn that the *enclosing* function
may be CPR'd (via the returned Justs).  But in the case of
sums, there may be Nothing alternatives; and that messes
up the sum-type CPR.

Conclusion: only do this for products.  It's still not
guaranteed OK for products, but sums definitely lose sometimes.

Note [CPR for thunks]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the rhs is a thunk, we usually forget the CPR info, because
it is presumably shared (else it would have been inlined, and
so we'd lose sharing if w/w'd it into a function).  E.g.

        let r = case expensive of
                  (a,b) -> (b,a)
        in ...

If we marked r as having the CPR property, then we'd w/w into

        let $wr = \() -> case expensive of
                            (a,b) -> (# b, a #)
            r = case $wr () of
                  (# b,a #) -> (b,a)
        in ...

But now r is a thunk, which won't be inlined, so we are no further ahead.
But consider

        f x = let r = case expensive of (a,b) -> (b,a)
              in if foo r then r else (x,x)

Does f have the CPR property?  Well, no.

However, if the strictness analyser has figured out (in a previous
iteration) that it's strict, then we DON'T need to forget the CPR info.
Instead we can retain the CPR info and do the thunk-splitting transform
(see WorkWrap.splitThunk).

This made a big difference to PrelBase.modInt, which had something like
        modInt = \ x -> let r = ... -> I# v in
                        ...body strict in r...
r's RHS isn't a value yet; but modInt returns r in various branches, so
if r doesn't have the CPR property then neither does modInt
Another case I found in practice (in Complex.magnitude), looks like this:
                let k = if ... then I# a else I# b
                in ... body strict in k ....
(For this example, it doesn't matter whether k is returned as part of
the overall result; but it does matter that k's RHS has the CPR property.)
Left to itself, the simplifier will make a join point thus:
                let $j k = ...body strict in k...
                if ... then $j (I# a) else $j (I# b)
With thunk-splitting, we get instead
                let $j x = let k = I#x in ...body strict in k...
                in if ... then $j a else $j b
This is much better; there's a good chance the I# won't get allocated.

But what about botCpr? Consider
    lvl = error "boom"
    fac -1 = lvl
    fac 0 = 1
    fac n = n * fac (n-1)
fac won't have the CPR property here when we trim every thunk! But the
assumption is that error cases are rarely entered and we are diverging anyway,
so WW doesn't hurt.

Note [CPR examples]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here are some examples (stranal/should_compile/T10482a) of the
usefulness of Note [CPR in a DataAlt case alternative].  The main
point: all of these functions can have the CPR property.

    ------- f1 -----------
    -- x is used strictly by h, so it'll be available
    -- unboxed before it is returned in the True branch

    f1 :: Int -> Int
    f1 x = case h x x of
            True  -> x
            False -> f1 (x-1)


    ------- f2 -----------
    -- x is a strict field of MkT2, so we'll pass it unboxed
    -- to $wf2, so it's available unboxed.  This depends on
    -- the case expression analysing (a subcomponent of) one
    -- of the original arguments to the function, so it's
    -- a bit more delicate.

    data T2 = MkT2 !Int Int

    f2 :: T2 -> Int
    f2 (MkT2 x y) | y>0       = f2 (MkT2 x (y-1))
                  | otherwise = x


    ------- f3 -----------
    -- h is strict in x, so x will be unboxed before it
    -- is rerturned in the otherwise case.

    data T3 = MkT3 Int Int

    f1 :: T3 -> Int
    f1 (MkT3 x y) | h x y     = f3 (MkT3 x (y-1))
                  | otherwise = x


    ------- f4 -----------
    -- Just like f2, but MkT4 can't unbox its strict
    -- argument automatically, as f2 can

    data family Foo a
    newtype instance Foo Int = Foo Int

    data T4 a = MkT4 !(Foo a) Int

    f4 :: T4 Int -> Int
    f4 (MkT4 x@(Foo v) y) | y>0       = f4 (MkT4 x (y-1))
                          | otherwise = v
