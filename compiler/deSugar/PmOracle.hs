{- Note [Recovering from unsatisfiable pattern-matching constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the following code (see #12957 and #15450):

  f :: Int ~ Bool => ()
  f = case True of { False -> () }

We want to warn that the pattern-matching in `f` is non-exhaustive. But GHC
used not to do this; in fact, it would warn that the match was /redundant/!
This is because the constraint (Int ~ Bool) in `f` is unsatisfiable, and the
coverage checker deems any matches with unsatifiable constraint sets to be
unreachable.

We decide to better than this. When beginning coverage checking, we first
check if the constraints in scope are unsatisfiable, and if so, we start
afresh with an empty set of constraints. This way, we'll get the warnings
that we expect.

{- Note [Type normalisation for EmptyCase]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
EmptyCase is an exception for pattern matching, since it is strict. This means
that it boils down to checking whether the type of the scrutinee is inhabited.
Function pmTopNormaliseType gets rid of the outermost type function/data
family redex and newtypes, in search of an algebraic type constructor, which is
easier to check for inhabitation.

It returns 3 results instead of one, because there are 2 subtle points:
1. Newtypes are isomorphic to the underlying type in core but not in the source
   language,
2. The representational data family tycon is used internally but should not be
   shown to the user

Hence, if pmTopNormaliseType env ty_cs ty = Just (src_ty, dcs, core_ty),
then
  (a) src_ty is the rewritten type which we can show to the user. That is, the
      type we get if we rewrite type families but not data families or
      newtypes.
  (b) dcs is the list of newtype constructors "skipped", every time we normalise
      a newtype to its core representation, we keep track of the source data
      constructor and the type we unwrap.
  (c) core_ty is the rewritten type. That is,
        pmTopNormaliseType env ty_cs ty = Just (src_ty, dcs, core_ty)
      implies
        topNormaliseType_maybe env ty = Just (co, core_ty)
      for some coercion co.

To see how all cases come into play, consider the following example:

  data family T a :: *
  data instance T Int = T1 | T2 Bool
  -- Which gives rise to FC:
  --   data T a
  --   data R:TInt = T1 | T2 Bool
  --   axiom ax_ti : T Int ~R R:TInt

  newtype G1 = MkG1 (T Int)
  newtype G2 = MkG2 G1

  type instance F Int  = F Char
  type instance F Char = G2

In this case pmTopNormaliseType env ty_cs (F Int) results in

  Just (G2, [(G2,MkG2),(G1,MkG1)], R:TInt)

Which means that in source Haskell:
  - G2 is equivalent to F Int (in contrast, G1 isn't).
  - if (x : R:TInt) then (MkG2 (MkG1 x) : F Int).

-----
-- Wrinkle: Local equalities
-----

Given the following type family:

  type family F a
  type instance F Int = Void

Should the following program (from #14813) be considered exhaustive?

  f :: (i ~ Int) => F i -> a
  f x = case x of {}

You might think "of course, since `x` is obviously of type Void". But the
idType of `x` is technically F i, not Void, so if we pass F i to
inhabitationCandidates, we'll mistakenly conclude that `f` is non-exhaustive.
In order to avoid this pitfall, we need to normalise the type passed to
pmTopNormaliseType, using the constraint solver to solve for any local
equalities (such as i ~ Int) that may be in scope.

  }

{- Note [The Pos/Neg invariant]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Invariant applying to each VarInfo: Whenever we have @(C, [y,z])@ in 'vi_pos',
any entry in 'vi_neg' must be incomparable to C (return Nothing) according to
'eqPmAltCons'. Those entries that are comparable either lead to a refutation
or are redudant. Examples:
* @x ~ Just y@, @x /~ [Just]@. 'eqPmAltCon' returns @Equal@, so refute.
* @x ~ Nothing@, @x /~ [Just]@. 'eqPmAltCon' returns @Disjoint@, so negative
  info is redundant and should be discarded.
* @x ~ I# y@, @x /~ [4,2]@. 'eqPmAltCon' returns @PossiblyOverlap@, so orthogal.
  We keep this info in order to be able to refute a redundant match on i.e. 4
  later on.

This carries over to pattern synonyms and overloaded literals. Say, we have
    pattern Just42 = Just 42
    case Just42 of x
      Nothing -> ()
      Just _  -> ()
Even though we had a solution for the value abstraction called x here in form
of a PatSynCon (Just42,[]), this solution is incomparable to both Nothing and
Just. Hence we retain the info in vi_neg, which eventually allows us to detect
the complete pattern match.

The Pos/Neg invariant extends to vi_cache, which stores essentially positive
information. We make sure that vi_neg and vi_cache never overlap. This isn't
strictly necessary since vi_cache is just a cache, so doesn't need to be
accurate: Every suggestion of a possible ConLike from vi_cache might be
refutable by the type oracle anyway. But it helps to maintain sanity while
debugging traces.

Note [Why record both positive and negative info?]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You might think that knowing positive info (like x ~ Just y) would render
negative info irrelevant, but not so because of pattern synonyms.  E.g we might
know that x cannot match (Foo 4), where pattern Foo p = Just p

Also overloaded literals themselves behave like pattern synonyms. E.g if
postively we know that (x ~ I# y), we might also negatively want to record that
x does not match 45 f 45       = e2 f (I# 22#) = e3 f 45       = e4  --
Overlapped

Note [TmState invariants]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The term oracle state is never obviously (i.e., without consulting the type
oracle) contradictory. This implies a few invariants:
* Whenever vi_pos overlaps with vi_neg according to 'eqPmAltCon', we refute.
  This is implied by the Note [Pos/Neg invariant].
* Whenever vi_neg subsumes a COMPLETE set, we refute. We consult vi_cache to
  detect this, but we could just compare whole COMPLETE sets to vi_neg every
  time, if it weren't for performance.

Maintaining these invariants in 'addVarVarCt' (the core of the term oracle) and
'addRefutableAltCon' is subtle.
* Merging VarInfos. Example: Add the fact @x ~ y@ (see 'equate').
  - (COMPLETE) If we had @x /~ True@ and @y /~ False@, then we get
    @x /~ [True,False]@. This is vacuous by matter of comparing to the vanilla
    COMPLETE set, so should refute.
  - (Pos/Neg) If we had @x /~ True@ and @y ~ True@, we have to refute.
* Adding positive information. Example: Add the fact @x ~ K ys@ (see 'addVarConCt')
  - (Neg) If we had @x /~ K@, refute.
  - (Pos) If we had @x ~ K2@, and that contradicts the new solution according to
    'eqPmAltCon' (ex. K2 is [] and K is (:)), then refute.
  - (Refine) If we had @x /~ K zs@, unify each y with each z in turn.
* Adding negative information. Example: Add the fact @x /~ Nothing@ (see 'addRefutableAltCon')
  - (Refut) If we have @x ~ K ys@, refute.
  - (Redundant) If we have @x ~ K2@ and @eqPmAltCon K K2 == Disjoint@
    (ex. Just and Nothing), the info is redundant and can be
    discarded.
  - (COMPLETE) If K=Nothing and we had @x /~ Just@, then we get
    @x /~ [Just,Nothing]@. This is vacuous by matter of comparing to the vanilla
    COMPLETE set, so should refute.

Note that merging VarInfo in equate can be done by calling out to 'addVarConCt' and
'addRefutableAltCon' for each of the facts individually.

Note [Representation of Strings in TmState]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Instead of treating regular String literals as a PmLits, we treat it as a list
of characters in the oracle for better overlap reasoning. The following example
shows why:

  f :: String -> ()
  f ('f':_) = ()
  f "foo"   = ()
  f _       = ()

The second case is redundant, and we like to warn about it. Therefore either
the oracle will have to do some smart conversion between the list and literal
representation or treat is as the list it really is at runtime.

The "smart conversion" has the advantage of leveraging the more compact literal
representation wherever possible, but is really nasty to get right with negative
equalities: Just think of how to encode @x /= "foo"@.
The "list" option is far simpler, but incurs some overhead in representation and
warning messages (which can be alleviated by someone with enough dedication).

Consider the situation in #11224

    import Text.Read (readMaybe)

    pattern PRead x <- (readMaybe -> Just x)
    f :: String -> Int
    f (PRead x)  = x
    f (PRead xs) = length xs
    f _          = 0

Is the first match exhaustive on the PRead synonym? Should the second line thus
deemed redundant? The answer is, of course, No! The required theta is like a
hidden parameter which must be supplied at the pattern match site, so PRead
is much more like a view pattern (where behavior depends on the particular value
passed in).
The simple solution here is to forget in 'addRefutableAltCon' that we matched
on synonyms with a required Theta like @PRead@, so that subsequent matches on
the same constructor are never flagged as redundant. The consequence is that
we no longer detect the actually redundant match in

    g :: String -> Int
    g (PRead x) = x
    g (PRead y) = y -- redundant!
    g _         = 0

But that's a small price to pay, compared to the proper solution here involving
storing required arguments along with the PmAltConLike in 'vi_neg'.

Note [Coverage checking and existential tyvars]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GHC's implementation of the pattern-match coverage algorithm (as described in
the GADTs Meet Their Match paper) must take some care to emit enough type
constraints when handling data constructors with exisentially quantified type
variables. To better explain what the challenge is, consider a constructor K
of the form:

  K @e_1 ... @e_m ev_1 ... ev_v ty_1 ... ty_n :: T u_1 ... u_p

Where:

* e_1, ..., e_m are the existentially bound type variables.
* ev_1, ..., ev_v are evidence variables, which may inhabit a dictionary type
  (e.g., Eq) or an equality constraint (e.g., e_1 ~ Int).
* ty_1, ..., ty_n are the types of K's fields.
* T u_1 ... u_p is the return type, where T is the data type constructor, and
  u_1, ..., u_p are the universally quantified type variables.

In the ConVar case, the coverage algorithm will have in hand the constructor
K as well as a list of type arguments [t_1, ..., t_n] to substitute T's
universally quantified type variables u_1, ..., u_n for. It's crucial to take
these in as arguments, as it is non-trivial to derive them just from the result
type of a pattern synonym and the ambient type of the match (#11336, #17112).
The type checker already did the hard work, so we should just make use of it.

The presence of existentially quantified type variables adds a significant
wrinkle. We always grab e_1, ..., e_m from the definition of K to begin with,
but we don't want them to appear in the final PmCon, because then
calling (mkOneConFull K) for other pattern variables might reuse the same
existential tyvars, which is certainly wrong.

Previously, GHC's solution to this wrinkle was to always create fresh names
for the existential tyvars and put them into the PmCon. This works well for
many cases, but it can break down if you nest GADT pattern matches in just
the right way. For instance, consider the following program:

    data App f a where
      App :: f a -> App f (Maybe a)

    data Ty a where
      TBool :: Ty Bool
      TInt  :: Ty Int

    data T f a where
      C :: T Ty (Maybe Bool)

    foo :: T f a -> App f a -> ()
    foo C (App TBool) = ()

foo is a total program, but with the previous approach to handling existential
tyvars, GHC would mark foo's patterns as non-exhaustive.

When foo is desugared to Core, it looks roughly like so:

    foo @f @a (C co1 _co2) (App @a1 _co3 (TBool |> co1)) = ()

(Where `a1` is an existential tyvar.)

That, in turn, is processed by the coverage checker to become:

    foo @f @a (C co1 _co2) (App @a1 _co3 (pmvar123 :: f a1))
      | TBool <- pmvar123 |> co1
      = ()

Note that the type of pmvar123 is `f a1`—this will be important later.

Now, we proceed with coverage-checking as usual. When we come to the
ConVar case for App, we create a fresh variable `a2` to represent its
existential tyvar. At this point, we have the equality constraints
`(a ~ Maybe a2, a ~ Maybe Bool, f ~ Ty)` in scope.

However, when we check the guard, it will use the type of pmvar123, which is
`f a1`. Thus, when considering if pmvar123 can match the constructor TInt,
it will generate the constraint `a1 ~ Int`. This means our final set of
equality constraints would be:

    f  ~ Ty
    a  ~ Maybe Bool
    a  ~ Maybe a2
    a1 ~ Int

Which is satisfiable! Freshening the existential tyvar `a` to `a2` doomed us,
because GHC is unable to relate `a2` to `a1`, which really should be the same
tyvar.

Luckily, we can avoid this pitfall. Recall that the ConVar case was where we
generated a PmCon with too-fresh existentials. But after ConVar, we have the
ConCon case, which considers whether each constructor of a particular data type
can be matched on in a particular spot.

In the case of App, when we get to the ConCon case, we will compare our
original App PmCon (from the source program) to the App PmCon created from the
ConVar case. In the former PmCon, we have `a1` in hand, which is exactly the
existential tyvar we want! Thus, we can force `a1` to be the same as `a2` here
by emitting an additional `a1 ~ a2` constraint. Now our final set of equality
constraints will be:

    f  ~ Ty
    a  ~ Maybe Bool
    a  ~ Maybe a2
    a1 ~ Int
    a1 ~ a2

Which is unsatisfiable, as we desired, since we now have that
Int ~ a1 ~ a2 ~ Bool.

In general, App might have more than one constructor, in which case we
couldn't reuse the existential tyvar for App for a different constructor. This
means that we can only use this trick in ConCon when the constructors are the
same. But this is fine, since this is the only scenario where this situation
arises in the first place!

-- * Detecting vacuous types

{- Note [Checking EmptyCase Expressions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Empty case expressions are strict on the scrutinee. That is, `case x of {}`
will force argument `x`. Hence, `checkMatches` is not sufficient for checking
empty cases, because it assumes that the match is not strict (which is true
for all other cases, apart from EmptyCase). This gave rise to #10746. Instead,
we do the following:

1. We normalise the outermost type family redex, data family redex or newtype,
   using pmTopNormaliseType (in types/FamInstEnv.hs). This computes 3
   things:
   (a) A normalised type src_ty, which is equal to the type of the scrutinee in
       source Haskell (does not normalise newtypes or data families)
   (b) The actual normalised type core_ty, which coincides with the result
       topNormaliseType_maybe. This type is not necessarily equal to the input
       type in source Haskell. And this is precicely the reason we compute (a)
       and (c): the reasoning happens with the underlying types, but both the
       patterns and types we print should respect newtypes and also show the
       family type constructors and not the representation constructors.

   (c) A list of all newtype data constructors dcs, each one corresponding to a
       newtype rewrite performed in (b).

   For an example see also Note [Type normalisation for EmptyCase]
   in types/FamInstEnv.hs.

2. Function Check.checkEmptyCase' performs the check:
   - If core_ty is not an algebraic type, then we cannot check for
     inhabitation, so we emit (_ :: src_ty) as missing, conservatively assuming
     that the type is inhabited.
   - If core_ty is an algebraic type, then we unfold the scrutinee to all
     possible constructor patterns, using inhabitationCandidates, and then
     check each one for constraint satisfiability, same as we do for normal
     pattern match checking.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the ConVar case of clause processing, each conlike K traditionally
generates two different forms of constraints:

* A term constraint (e.g., x ~ K y1 ... yn)
* Type constraints from the conlike's context (e.g., if K has type
  forall bs. Q => s1 .. sn -> T tys, then Q would be its type constraints)

As it turns out, these alone are not enough to detect a certain class of
unreachable code. Consider the following example (adapted from #15305):

  data K = K1 | K2 !Void

  f :: K -> ()
  f K1 = ()

Even though `f` doesn't match on `K2`, `f` is exhaustive in its patterns. Why?
Because it's impossible to construct a terminating value of type `K` using the
`K2` constructor, and thus it's impossible for `f` to ever successfully match
on `K2`.

The reason is because `K2`'s field of type `Void` is //strict//. Because there
are no terminating values of type `Void`, any attempt to construct something
using `K2` will immediately loop infinitely or throw an exception due to the
strictness annotation. (If the field were not strict, then `f` could match on,
say, `K2 undefined` or `K2 (let x = x in x)`.)

Since neither the term nor type constraints mentioned above take strict
argument types into account, we make use of the `nonVoid` function to
determine whether a strict type is inhabitable by a terminating value or not.

`nonVoid ty` returns True when either:
1. `ty` has at least one InhabitationCandidate for which both its term and type
   constraints are satifiable, and `nonVoid` returns `True` for all of the
   strict argument types in that InhabitationCandidate.
2. We're unsure if it's inhabited by a terminating value.

`nonVoid ty` returns False when `ty` is definitely uninhabited by anything
(except bottom). Some examples:

* `nonVoid Void` returns False, since Void has no InhabitationCandidates.
  (This is what lets us discard the `K2` constructor in the earlier example.)
* `nonVoid (Int :~: Int)` returns True, since it has an InhabitationCandidate
  (through the Refl constructor), and its term constraint (x ~ Refl) and
  type constraint (Int ~ Int) are satisfiable.
* `nonVoid (Int :~: Bool)` returns False. Although it has an
  InhabitationCandidate (by way of Refl), its type constraint (Int ~ Bool) is
  not satisfiable.
* Given the following definition of `MyVoid`:

    data MyVoid = MkMyVoid !Void

  `nonVoid MyVoid` returns False. The InhabitationCandidate for the MkMyVoid
  constructor contains Void as a strict argument type, and since `nonVoid Void`
  returns False, that InhabitationCandidate is discarded, leaving no others.

* Performance considerations

We must be careful when recursively calling `nonVoid` on the strict argument
types of an InhabitationCandidate, because doing so naïvely can cause GHC to
fall into an infinite loop. Consider the following example:

  data Abyss = MkAbyss !Abyss

  stareIntoTheAbyss :: Abyss -> a
  stareIntoTheAbyss x = case x of {}

In principle, stareIntoTheAbyss is exhaustive, since there is no way to
construct a terminating value using MkAbyss. However, both the term and type
constraints for MkAbyss are satisfiable, so the only way one could determine
that MkAbyss is unreachable is to check if `nonVoid Abyss` returns False.
There is only one InhabitationCandidate for Abyss—MkAbyss—and both its term
and type constraints are satisfiable, so we'd need to check if `nonVoid Abyss`
returns False... and now we've entered an infinite loop!

To avoid this sort of conundrum, `nonVoid` uses a simple test to detect the
presence of recursive types (through `checkRecTc`), and if recursion is
detected, we bail out and conservatively assume that the type is inhabited by
some terminating value. This avoids infinite loops at the expense of making
the coverage checker incomplete with respect to functions like
stareIntoTheAbyss above. Then again, the same problem occurs with recursive
newtypes, like in the following code:

  newtype Chasm = MkChasm Chasm

  gazeIntoTheChasm :: Chasm -> a
  gazeIntoTheChasm x = case x of {} -- Erroneously warned as non-exhaustive

So this limitation is somewhat understandable.

Note that even with this recursion detection, there is still a possibility that
`nonVoid` can run in exponential time. Consider the following data type:

  data T = MkT !T !T !T

If we call `nonVoid` on each of its fields, that will require us to once again
check if `MkT` is inhabitable in each of those three fields, which in turn will
require us to check if `MkT` is inhabitable again... As you can see, the
branching factor adds up quickly, and if the recursion depth limit is, say,
100, then `nonVoid T` will effectively take forever.

To mitigate this, we check the branching factor every time we are about to call
`nonVoid` on a list of strict argument types. If the branching factor exceeds 1
(i.e., if there is potential for exponential runtime), then we limit the
maximum recursion depth to 1 to mitigate the problem. If the branching factor
is exactly 1 (i.e., we have a linear chain instead of a tree), then it's okay
to stick with a larger maximum recursion depth.

Another microoptimization applies to data types like this one:

  data S a = ![a] !T

Even though there is a strict field of type [a], it's quite silly to call
nonVoid on it, since it's "obvious" that it is inhabitable. To make this
intuition formal, we say that a type is definitely inhabitable (DI) if:

  * It has at least one constructor C such that:
    1. C has no equality constraints (since they might be unsatisfiable)
    2. C has no strict argument types (since they might be uninhabitable)

It's relatively cheap to check if a type is DI, so before we call `nonVoid`
on a list of strict argument types, we filter out all of the DI ones.
