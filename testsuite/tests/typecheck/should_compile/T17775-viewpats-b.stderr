T17775-viewpats-b.hs:7:9: error:
    • No instance for (Eq a) arising from a use of ‘==’
      Possible fix:
        add (Eq a) to the context of
          the type signature for:
            ex2 :: forall a. a -> a -> Int -> Eq a => Bool
    • In the expression: == x
      In the pattern: (== x) -> result
      In an equation for ‘ex2’: ex2 x ((== x) -> result) = \ _ -> result
