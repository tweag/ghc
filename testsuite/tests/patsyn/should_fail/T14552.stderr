    • Cannot generalise type; skolem ‘k’ would escape its scope
      if I tried to quantify (aa0 :: k) in this type:
        forall k (w :: k --> *). Exp a0 (F @k @(*) w aa0)
      (Indeed, I sometimes struggle even printing this correctly,
       due to its ill-scoped nature.)
    • In the declaration for pattern synonym ‘FOO’
