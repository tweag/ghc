    A levity-polymorphic type is not allowed here:

    When trying to create a variable of type: a

T13233.hs:27:10: error:
    Cannot use function with levity-polymorphic arguments:
      mkWeak# :: a
                 -> b

    (Note that levity-polymorphic primops such as 'coerce' and unboxed tuples
    are eta-expanded internally because they must occur fully saturated.
    Use -fprint-typechecker-elaboration to display the full expression.)
